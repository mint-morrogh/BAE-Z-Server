Adding 0_ZenSleepPersistenceEnable.pbo to your server pack will enable persistence for some of the sleep variables, such as the effect of epinephrine (fatigue drain pause) and inability to sleep due to adrenaline (injury-induced "buzz"). This will require a server wipe to add and a wipe to remove, hence why it's optional.

ZenSleepVPPAT.pbo is a compatibility patch for VPP Admin Tools - https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1828439124

You will need to add it to your server's mudpack to enable it. It just allows setting the sleep stat using VPPAT.

I had to separate it from core integration to my mod and make it optional because it can cause issues with certain mod lists, it seems.

ZenTerjeOverrides.pbo is a compatibility mod for Terje's Medicine. If you want to use my sleep mod with Terje's Medicine mod, turn off his sleep system in Medicine.cfg and add my override .pbo to your server's modpack.
